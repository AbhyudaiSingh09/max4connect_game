# MaxConnect4 Game

## Overview
MaxConnect4 is an implementation of a two-player connection game where players alternately drop colored discs into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. This implementation of MaxConnect4 is designed to play the game using a depth-limited version of the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. It can be played in two modes: interactive and one-move.

## Installation
To run this game, you will need Python installed on your system. The game was developed and tested with Python 3.11.
